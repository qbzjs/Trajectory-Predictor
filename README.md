# BCI-Trial-Manager-VR
 
Current Tested Unity version:
2020.3..

May require Steam VR..

This software is a flexible BCI framework paradigm for motion based kinematic limb experiments or trials. The framework has adjustible timing and event triggers to work with simulink based motor BCI. The development is somewhat ad-hoc as it is only intended to be used by BCI researchers in Ulster University ISRC SCANi-Hub. 

On running you will have to set up the timing as required
Once set up, settings are saved between sessions.

Kinematic data is recorded in CSV files to your appdata folder (persistent data folder)
